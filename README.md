# ESP32 Based Remote for controlling VESC based dual motor robots

This project is based on the TTGO T-Display board which is an inexpensive ESP32 based development board that includes an OLED, WiFi, BLE, and a battery management chip that can charge a single cell LiPo.

This is currently a work in progress and will require some additional work to get the CAN forwarding enabled in the VescUart project
